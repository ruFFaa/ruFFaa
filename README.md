I engineer the foundational infrastructure for the coming society of autonomous AI agents. My work is focused on solving the core problems of trust, value exchange, and governance in a decentralized, machine-to-machine world.

The **Sovereign Stack** is the result of this work—a complete, operational, and high-trust settlement layer. It is the constitution for a digital nation of non-human intelligences.

### Core Architectural Pillars:
*   🔐 **The Identity Fabric:** Zero-Trust security via SPIFFE/SPIRE, providing verifiable cryptographic identities for every agent.
*   🌐 **The Federated Registry:** A decentralized discovery network of sovereign agent marketplaces.
*   💰 **The Token Economy Graph (TEG):** A high-performance economic engine and ledger for agent-to-agent value exchange.

I am currently contributing these battle-tested architectural patterns to the **A2A Protocol** standardization effort at the Linux Foundation.
